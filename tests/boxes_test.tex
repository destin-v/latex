An example theorem is shown in theorem~\ref{th:pnt}, and there is
example~\ref{ex:bertrand}.
\begin{Theorem}{Prime Number Theorem (PNT)}{pnt}
    \begin{equation*}
        \pi(x)\sim\frac{x}{\log x}
    \end{equation*}
\end{Theorem}

\begin{Example}{Generalisation of Bertrand's Postulate}{bertrand}
    Let $\varepsilon>0$. Prove that there exist a prime between $n$ and
    $(1+\varepsilon)n$ for all large $n$, in particular there always exist a
    prime between $n$ and $2n$ for $n>1$.
\end{Example}

\begin{Definition}{Ordinary}
    An ordinary differential equation, often abbreviated as an ODE, is a
    differential equation that is in the form of:
    \begin{equation*}
        F(x,y,y',y''\cdots)=0
    \end{equation*}
